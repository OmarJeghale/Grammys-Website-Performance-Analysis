# 🎵 Grammys Website Performance Analysis

## 📘 Project Overview

This project analyzes The Recording Academy’s decision to split its content between **grammys.com** and **recordingacademy.com** starting in 2022. Using Python and web analytics data, I investigated how the split affected user behavior, engagement, and overall traffic patterns.

The goal was to determine whether the split improved performance metrics and to deliver **data-backed recommendations** that help optimize both sites going forward.

## 📌 Final Recommendation

The data suggests that the split into **two distinct domains** (Grammys and Recording Academy) helped reduce bounce rates and improve engagement consistency. I recommend continuing with the two-site approach while optimizing each site for its **target audience** — younger users for Grammys and more professional or industry-focused users for Recording Academy.

To enhance engagement further, strategies like **interactive content**, **post-award follow-ups**, and **deep-linking between the two sites** are worth exploring.

## 🤖 ChatGPT Collaboration
